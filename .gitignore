# --- Task ---
# Keeping task/ folder as per user context usually, but checking previous gitignore... 
# Previous ignored 'task/', but user is using task/stage4.md. 
# I will NOT ignore task/ folder for now so user can see progress docs if they want? 
# Wait, previous gitignore had 'task/'. I should respect that if user considers it temporary.
# But user relies on task.md in brain now. 
# Let's ignore local task folder if it contains massive logs, but maybe keep docs?
# I'll keep 'task/' ignored if it was ignored before, to be safe.
